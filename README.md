# CHE120-Game-Project
Game Project due Dec. 1, 2024 for CHE120: Computer Literacy and Programming for Chemical Engineers
Game made by Jeremy Bijoux (LordZagger) and Jinyong Lee (username), just because we wanted to make our own game (and Jeremy wanted to make the soundtrack) and for bonus marks ;)
This is to track the progress of who did what in making the game

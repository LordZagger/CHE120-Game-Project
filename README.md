# CHE120-Game-Project
Game Project due Dec. 3rd, 2024 for CHE120: Computer Literacy and Programming for Chemical Engineers
Game made by Jeremy Bijoux (LordZagger) and Jinyong Lee (Jin4843), just because we wanted to make our own game (and Jeremy wanted to make the soundtrack) and for bonus marks ;)
This is to track the progress of who did what in making the game, as well as a place to store all the images and files used in-game
Of course, the GitHub reposity also has the python game file

wav files are music, png files are images, py file is the game, and please check out the pdf Rulebook for more detailed instructions on how to play

There were issues with the game on the release of Dec 3rd (only part of episode 1), so Jeremy fixed the issues of Episode 1 from Dec 24-27
We recommend playing the game on a software like Spyder, as there are some console prompts to keep track off during battles
